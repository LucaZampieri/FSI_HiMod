    @brief Simple Fourier test with Dirichlet Boundary condition

    @author Umberto Villa <uvilla@emory.edu>
    @date 14-04-2010

     Solve the problem

           \partial_t u - \nu(t) \Delta u + sigma(t) u = f(t)

                    u = g on the boundary
                        u(t=0) = u0 initial condition

            on a cube
            \nu, \sigma and \source can be function of time
            (which implies that the matrix needs to be reassembled each time)

    Purpose: Test BDF of different order

    The analytical solution used in the test is quadratic both in space and time.
    Therefore a second order approximation in space + BDF2 should provide a solution exact up to
    the tolerance of the linear system.
