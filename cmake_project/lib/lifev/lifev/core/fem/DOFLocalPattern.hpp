//! Local pattern type
/*!
  This enum allows to distinguish the normal standard local pattern, which is a full pattern involving all
  degrees of freedom to special patterns. It is stored in DOFLocalPattern for later use by Dof
*/

enum DofPatternType {STANDARD_PATTERN = 1,
                     P1ISOP2_SEG_PATTERN = 2,
                     P1ISOP2_TRIA_PATTERN = 3
                    };

//! DOFLocalPattern - A class to store the "couplings" between the basis functions
/*!
  The aim of this class is to store the way the basis functions couple one with each other. This might seem useless,
  however, some "advanced" finite elements require this structure.

  For example, consider the P1-iso-P2 element in 2D. This finite element is composed of 6 basis functions, based on the
  nodes with the same numbering as the P2 element. The reference triangle is split into 4 subtriangles using the
  nodes on the faces. Each basis function is build such that it is 1 on its node, 0 on all the other nodes and such that
  it is linear in each subtriangle.

  @see in "Numerical Approximation of Partial Differential Equations" by A. Quarteroni and A. Valli, p.311, for an
  illustration and further informations.

  With this definition of the P1-iso-P2 finite element, we see that the basis functions 1 and 2 have no common support.
  So, they are not directly coupled.

  In order to represent the couplings between the basis functions, we can use a matrix \f$ C \f$ such that
  \f$ C_{ij} = 1 \f$ if the basis functions \f$ i \f$ and \f$ j \f$ have a common support, otherwise it is \f$ 0 \f$.
  This matrix is symmetric.

  For the P1-iso-P2 element, this matrix would be:
  \f[
  \begin{array}{|c||cccccc|}
  \hline
   & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
  \hline
  \hline
  1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
  2 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
  3 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  4 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
  5 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
  6 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
  \hline
  \end{array}
  \f]

  When references to diagonal or upper part are made, it is with respect to this matrix. For most of the finite
  elements, this matrix is full (lagrangian FE, lagrangian FE with bubbles,...).

  Instead of this representation with a matrix, we usually prefer to get the DoFs that are coupled in a list. This
  is the implemented in this class and the list of pairs (patternFirst(i),patternSecond(i)) represents all the DoFs
  that are coupled.


  Note: The documentation of this class (and some improvements) has been done by Samuel Quinodoz (15.01.2010),
  but its original implementation was prior the documentation and no name of author or date was available.
