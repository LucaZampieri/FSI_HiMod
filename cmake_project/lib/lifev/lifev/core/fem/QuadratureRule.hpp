  <b> Definition of a quadrature rule </b>

  To define a quadrature rule, several constructors have been defined for this class. Besides the classical constructors, one is provided with an arbitrary number of arguements (indicated by "..."). Its usage is quite simple: first of all, one defines the standard arguements (name...) but also the number of quadrature points and their dimension. After that, one add the coordinates and weights of the quadrature points in the order: coordinates for the first point, weight for the first point, coordinates of the second point, weight of the second point,...

For example, if we want to define a Simpson rule in 1D, we can write:
 \code
  QuadratureRule simpson1D ("Simpson 1D",LINE,1,3,3,  // name,shape,dimension,exactness,number of points
                      0.0, 1.0/6.0,             // first point: x=0 with weight 1/6
                      0.5, 2.0/3.0,             // second point: x=0.5, weight 2/3
                      1.0, 1.0/6.0);            // third point: x=1, weight 1/6
  \endcode

If we want to see this quadrature as a 1D quadrature in a 2D space, the code would have been:

\code
  QuadratureRule simpson2D ("Simpson 2D",LINE,2,3,3,  // name,shape,dimension,exactness,number of points
                      0.0,0.0, 1.0/6.0,         // first point: (0,0) with weight 1/6
                      0.5,0.0, 2.0/3.0,         // second point: (0.5,0) weight 2/3
                      1.0,0.0, 1.0/6.0);        // third point: (1,0) weight 1/6
  \endcode

The following code would have produced the same quadrature:

\code
  QuadratureRule simpson2D (simpson1D,2);
  \endcode

  <b> Basic Use </b>

  A quadrature rule consists mainly in a container of quadrature points. The stored quadrature points can be accessed through accessors to the quadrature points or through specific accessors for the coordinates and the weight of the quadrature points.

  <b> Degree of exactness </b>

  The quadrature rules store the degree of exactness that they are supposed to achieve. It can be specified when building the quadrature rule. No test is performed automatically to check the order and when the quadrature rule is modified (with the addPoint method for example), the order of exactness is kept unchanged.

  However, the QuadratureRule class provides a test for the degree of exactness. When called, this test returns the degree of exactness that has been found by trying to perform several integrals, but it does not change the stored degree of exactness.

  <b> Dimension and Shape </b>

  For some problems, it makes sens to use quadrature rules outside their "original" space, e.g. one could need a quadrature rule for the triangles in a 3D space (when integrating on a surface). The QuadratureRule class provides the possibility of changing the dimension in which a quadrature rule in defined (i.e. how many coordinates are used for the coordinates of the quadrature points).

  When using a quadrature rule in a space with higher dimension, 0 coordinates are added to fill the missing coordinates. The shape of the quadrature (i.e. the geometric shape where it is defined) remains the same.

  It is currently not possible to move a quadrature to a lower space dimension (than the one defined by its shape): the problem resides in the area of the quadrature: a quadrature rule for tetrahedra has a total weight of 1/6 while a quadrature rule for triangles has a total weight of 1/2 (in general for simplexes, the area is 1/n!). If such change would be allowed, one would have to implement all the changes of weight depending on the shape (there is no such phenomena between hexahedra and quadrangles for example). Moreover, it makes very little sense to downgrade a quadrature (use a specific quadrature rule which will have very likely less quadrature nodes).
