DOFInterface* files should be moved to FSI module. 
In order to do this we need to factor out specific 
routines in exporterHDF5 and maybe some other files.
One option is to create an exporterHDF5_FSI that
derives from exporterHDF5.

Activation of BOOST spirit should depend on standard 
defined cmake variables.

(I've made Boost spirit enabled by default. It can be disabled
by the user: -D LifeV_Core_ENABLE_SPIRIT_PARSER:BOOL=OFF
or if the detected Boost version is too old. --Radu)

Do we want to move to the pedantic compilation?
Right now, it is activated by default, to remove it specify:
 -D LifeV_ENABLE_STRONG_CXX_COMPILE_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF \

Right now, FindTPLTrilinos.cmake will not remove duplicate includes and libraries.
there is a limitation in TrilinosConfig.cmake that does not
allow to get single TPL information. TriBITS should be
improved to make this possible (eg. generate TrilinosTPL.cmake
with <TPL>_INCLUDE_DIR and <TPL>_LIBRARY_DIR).

Understand why in each module/CMakeLists.txt we need the line
SET(${PACKAGE_NAME}_VERSION "3.0")
