# This test holds a method to reorder the meshes reducing the fill-in of the matrix,
# and a method to create a different marker on a region of a mesh.
# In particular this region is identified by a marker of another mesh that shares an interface
# (e.g. solid interface and fluid edges in FSI).

# For instance suppose that you have marker=20 on the fluid 'edges'
# and on the solid mesh you have just different markers for the internal and external walls,
# then using this test you can create a marker '30' on the solid mesh whenever the corresponding marker on the fluid
# mesh is '20', and rewrite the mesh.

# usage: test_meshReorder -o mesh_output.mesh
#
# without the options -o or --output the output mesh can be specified from this data file.
# Otherwise the mesh will be written in a file 'mesh'.

# the first mesh is the one reordered. The second mesh is the one where the new marker is added
# (not read when create_edge=false).
